# React + Vite Project

This is a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules for a smooth development experience.

## Technologies Used:
- **React** for the front-end UI
- **Vite** as the build tool with HMR support
- **ESLint** for code linting
- **Optional Plugins**:
  - `@vitejs/plugin-react`: Uses Babel for Fast Refresh
  - `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`: Uses SWC for Fast Refresh
